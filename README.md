# English Learning Tool

This is a English learning tool I built for my parents, but feel free to use if you find it helpful! It contains the following 2 features:
- load a local video and a custom timestamp file to play it like Youtube with chapters (I have LEGALLY acquired a Chinese new concept textbook reading, which have lessons that can be tagged as timestamps).
- load a local file to include vocabulary from all lessons for ease of memorization. You can test yourself like one of those memory card apps by selecting a range of lessons and it will shuffle the words and test you accordingly. Sounds can be loaded in addition for better learning (an automated script using Amazon Polly is included for convenience). You can also cross some words that you do not see worth testing, but this action can be reversed at anytime.

## How to Start

This is a local web tool built with React, so just fire it off with `npm start` in the root.
